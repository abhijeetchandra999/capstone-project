## Capstone Project  
**TMDB Movie Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling**  
*Personal End-to-End Project*

- Analyzed TMDB dataset using Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Central Tendency) and built a KPI dashboard.
- Created SQL Views & Stored Procedures; performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with advanced SQL.
- Built interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize trends across genres, language, revenue, and ratings.
- Utilized Python for extensive data preprocessing: missing value treatment, outlier handling, data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, and statistical analysis (z-test, sampling).
- Developed and evaluated 4 machine learning models:
    - **KNN:** Predicted movie ratings and deployed model to a website.
    - **Linear Regression:** Predicted movie revenue.
    - **Logistic Regression:** Predicted genre from features.
    - **K-Means Clustering:** Identified patterns in top-rated movies (unsupervised ML).
- Presented findings and actionable business recommendations for new movie makers.
